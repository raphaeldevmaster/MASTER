            <h2> Why use online text formatting tools? </h2>
            <p> Have you ever got a text that was long and needed to be formatted? And looking at it, you thought that it was going to be difficult and boring? We all know how it feels. And that's why we created this website. We did it to help you not spend
                too much time doing this, so you can have fun or anything you prefer. We chose to make it simple, and you only need to paste your text here and press one button, and it's ready to go. </p>
            <p> You need to be focused on every detail while reviewing a written work because this is how the reader's experience is going to be. We all know that we are humans, and sometimes we make mistakes. But we are also smart, and we can look for something
                that can help us, or even better, we can create something to facilitate our tasks.
                <p> Thinking about that, people created text formatting tools. But there are two types of tools: software installed on your computer (apps) and online (websites). </p>
                <p> Why it's better to use online text formatting tools? </p>
                <p> Using apps, first, we need to find an app, download it, and install it on our computer. But we don't always find a good app at first. If the app is not good, we must repeat it all over again. Well, it sucks when this happens, right? </p>
                <p>
                But it's even worse when we do it all, find a good app, and then a message pops up, saying that we need to pay to continue using. Sometimes we give up and waste our time doing it ourselves. </p>
                <p> But why use apps if we can do it online? </p>
                <p> It's so much easier and faster to go to your browser and search for a website. You don't spend time reading reviews before you install it. You don't have to uninstall it if you don't like it. You only need to search for a new site. Each
                    site has different tools to use. </p>
                <p>Stop wasting your time searching for apps and go to https://lowertoupper.com/ and try it. It's free for everyone. Don't spend your time formatting text when you can spend it doing whatever you want to do. We're here to help you </p>
                <p>
                So count on lowertoupper to help you on this journey. </p>
